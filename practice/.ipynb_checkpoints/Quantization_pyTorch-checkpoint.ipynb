    "\n",
    "* Reduced size and faster inference speed with about the same accuracy as the original model.\n",
    "*  Quantization can be applied to both server and mobile model deployment, but it can be especially important or even critical on mobile, because a non-quantized model’s size may exceed the limit that an iOS or Android app allows for, cause the deployment or OTA update to take too much time, and make the inference too slow for a good user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "* Quantization is a technique that converts 32-bit floating numbers in the model parameters to 8-bit integers. \n",
    "* With quantization, the model size and memory footprint can be reduced to 1/4 of its original size, and the inference can be made about 2-4 times faster, while the accuracy stays about the same.\n",
    "* There are overall three approaches or workflows to quantize a model: \n",
    "    * Post training dynamic quantization\n",
    "    * Post training static quantization\n",
    "    * Quantization aware training\n",
    "* But if the model you want to use already has a quantized version, you can use it directly without going through any of the three workflows above. For example, the torchvision library already includes quantized versions for models MobileNet v2, ResNet 18, ResNet 50, Inception v3, GoogleNet, among others. So we will make the last approach another workflow, albeit a simple one.\n",
