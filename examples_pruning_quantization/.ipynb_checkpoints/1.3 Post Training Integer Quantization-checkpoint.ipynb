    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer quantization is an optimization strategy that converts 32-bit floating-point numbers (such as weights and activation outputs) to the nearest 8-bit fixed-point numbers. This results in a smaller model and increased inferencing speed, which is valuable for low-power devices such as microcontrollers. This data format is also required by integer-only accelerators such as the Edge TPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll train an MNIST model from scratch, convert it into a Tensorflow Lite file, and quantize it using [post-training quantization](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization). Finally, you'll check the accuracy of the converted model and compare it to the original float model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You actually have several options as to how much you want to quantize a model. In this tutorial, you'll perform \"full integer quantization,\" which converts all weights and activation outputs into 8-bit integer dataâ€”whereas other strategies may leave some amount of data in floating-point.\n",
    "\n",
